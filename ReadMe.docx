Game is a space shooter, where you should shoot meteors and destroy them, if you collide with them you will lose.
it uses art referencing Shimeji Simulation, to which obsticles used have thematic connection, backgrounds used are directly art from it
obsticle pngs where free assets modified by me

Inputs:
W A S D or arrow keys for movement
Space or Left Click for shooting a laser
Shift for sprint
P for pause/unpause
M for Main Menu
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Difficulties: each difficulty scales spawn rate and speed of each obsticle. additionally longer game goes on faster obsticle will spawn, it had quadratic (exponential) increase till it reaches specific point after which spawn rate wont change (being 0.1 seconds for Hard)
score: score is calculated based on time spent playing and obsticles destroyed, each obsticle increases score by diferent amount, they are displayed on bottom middle while ingame

UI explained:
game starts in Main Menu, where you can select difficulties, for each difficulty there is unique Highest Score and Best Time displayed.

on bottom left there is a button for settings, settings lets you modify volume for game music, explosion sound and laser sound, 
pressing save button will save modifcation while pressing back will discard it, both of those buttons brings you back to main menu.

clicking Play will start the game.


while ingame you can click Menu button on bottom left, which will bring you to Main Menu with same functionalities but with additional Resume button, which lets you resume the game
if you click Play button it will restart the game, Resume button is only clickable if youre selecting same difficulty as ongoing game, you cant change difficulties mid game



Game Over UI appears when player dies, it displays score, time survived and difficulty,
there are two button one to Replay on same difficulty and second called Menu which brings you to main menu

Explenation to each class (CrabMeteor LobsterMeteor and TrackerMeteor use AI): 

Player.lua handles the player or whats supposed to be a spaceship, it has speed and normalised diagonal movement, player moves with arrow keys or with wasd
it interacts with laser class and can shoot a laser when player presses space key, it should be defined after laser class in main.lua

Laser.lua handles the laser that player shoots, it destroys meteors on impact, it uses pixel precise collision. it moves only vertically.


Obsticles:
(speed and spawn rate influenced by difficulty)

Meteor.lua is the most common obsticle, it has egg png image, its speed and angle at which it moves is random. 

PhoenixMeteor.lua has a lemon shape, is similar to basic meteor but instead it takes 2 hits to be destroyed, 
hitting it once will change its png to more destroyed lemon and hitting it second time will destroy it

TrackerMeteor.lua has AI, also lemon shaped but without a leaf, it is fastest obsticle and it is guranteed to cross the path to where player was standing when it spawned, 
it moves on angle like normal meteor so it uses trygonometry to calculate the angle at which it should go based on what x and y coordinatae it spawned compared to player

CrabMeteor.lua spawns directly above the player, it moves vertically, its horizontal movement follows wherever player currently goes/is, however it is slower than the player

LobsterMeteor.lua spawns directly above the player, it has additional rectangular hitboxes which checks for closest laser/player, 
if its laser, tries to move away from it by changing x coordinate, if its player it moves towards player by changing x coordinate

AnimatedExplosion.lua class used to animated when obsticles are destroyed, it doesnt use split multiple-frame sprite because it wasnt required in this task and
better quality explosion image I have wasnt designed to work as split multiple-frame sprite, instead it uses explosion folder and iterated over pngs
